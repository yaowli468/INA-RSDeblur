put test blur into "./Blur_AID_Datasets/test/blur/"; put test target into "./Blur_AID_Datasets/test/target/"; put train blur-target into "./Blur_AID_Datasets/train/", Note that blur image and target image need to be combined, then obtain blur-target; 

For Example: 
Test Image / Train Image: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1gEGloXoT8anwVrIjnXlxiA (w4mm)
